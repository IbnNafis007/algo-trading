# Chapter 7: Money Management Formulas

## 2% and 6% rules

- limit **loss per trade to 2%** of trading account
  - Example:
    - trading account of $100,000
    - want to buy stock X at $10, profit target at $14, stop loss at $8 (i.e. risking $2 per share)
    - $100,000 x 2% = $2,000
    - $2,000 / $2 = 1,000 shares
    - remeber to factor in fees

- **stop trading for this month** when value of trading account dips **6% below** its closing value at the end of **last month**.
  - calculate equity every day
  - stop trading when today's equity is 6% lower than the last day of the previous month
  - review trading system
  
 ## Steps

 - calculate 2%
 - calculate 6%
 - for every trade, decide on entry point and stop. express risk per share.
 - do as *Example* above
 - calculate risk on all open positions: (distance from entry point to current stop) x (number of shares)
 - if risk < 6%, add a trade
